mount needs:
- name
- type(?)
    - Enum?
        - contains mount name?
            - this would not necessarily reduce overhead, just require an additional function/object for discerning
              between items when presenting e.g. name of a mount to a user in a report, etc.
- vehicle spaces
    - fixed mount spaces = weapon spaces = vehicle spaces
    - gun port = 0
    - small turret = 1
    - bay = weapon spaces = vehicle spaces
    - large turret = 4 + crew
- maximum spaces
    - fixed mount = 0 (unless launching drones, but this is a separate rule)
    - gun port = 0 (can't "mount" weapons)
    - small turret = 4
    - large turret = 0
    - pintle/ring mount = 2
- firing arc
    - All
    - Front
    - Left
    - Right
    - Rear
- weapons
    - bay, multi-bay, hardpoint = only one-shot weapons (missiles, bombs, etc.)
    - gun port = none
    - turrets, fixed mount, pintle/ring = any
- cost
    - gun port = flat cost
    - fixed mount = weapon cost
    - hardpoint, bay, turret = per space
- customizations
    - gun shield (only pintle/ring)
    - pop-up, modular (all)
